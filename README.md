#tabtab-commander

Tab/Auto Completion for Commander.js CLIs.

based on: https://github.com/bencevans/commander-tabtab.js (credit Ben Evans)

BUT you can tab for files after a command, not just commands forever.

tabtab-commander:
```git push pul -> git push <filename that starts with pul>```

commander-tabtab:
```git push pul -> git push pull```

See commander-tabtab README for directions until we build out this one. Simply replace anywhere it says "commander-tabtab" with "tabtab-commander".
